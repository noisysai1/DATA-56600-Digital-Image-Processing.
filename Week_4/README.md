# Week 4 ‚Äì Image Denoising using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

### üß≠ Overview
This week focused on **image restoration and denoising** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**.  
The goal was to develop a neural network model capable of removing noise from corrupted images while preserving essential image features like edges and textures.  

The experiment involved uploading images, introducing artificial Gaussian noise and then using a CNN model to generate denoised outputs.

## üß© Key Concepts

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Image Denoising
Image denoising is the process of removing unwanted noise from images while retaining important details.  
Noise can originate from sensor errors, poor lighting or transmission distortion.  
By leveraging CNNs, we can perform **learning-based denoising**, allowing the model to automatically learn noise patterns and remove them effectively.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
CNNs are ideal for denoising because they:
- Extract spatial patterns (edges, textures) from noisy inputs.
- Learn filters that differentiate between noise and meaningful features.
- Use **ReLU activation** for non-linearity and **convolutional layers** for localized learning.
- Employ **pooling** to reduce dimensionality and avoid overfitting.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Algorithm Design

### üîπ Step 1: Upload and Preprocess Images
We Can uploads one or more images using `files.upload()` in Google Colab.  
Images are resized to a uniform **256√ó256** resolution and converted to **grayscale** for simplified computation.

```python
import cv2, numpy as np
from google.colab import files

uploaded = files.upload()
desired_height, desired_width = 256, 256
input_images = []

for path in uploaded.keys():
    image = cv2.imread(path, cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
    image = cv2.resize(image, (desired_width, desired_height))
    input_images.append(image.reshape((1, image.shape[0], image.shape[1], 1)))


üîπ Step 2: Add Gaussian Noise

To simulate real-world noise, Gaussian noise is added to the input images.

noisy_images = []
for image in input_images:
    noise = np.random.normal(loc=0, scale=1, size=image.shape)
    noisy_image = np.clip(image + noise, 0, 1)
    noisy_images.append(noisy_image)

Mean = 0

Standard deviation = 1

Pixel values are clipped to stay within [0, 1].

This step generates noisy versions of the original images for training and evaluation.


üîπ Step 3: Define CNN-based Denoising Model

The CNN denoising model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, consisting of multiple convolutional layers followed by an output layer.

Each convolutional layer applies several filters to extract hierarchical features, gradually learning to reconstruct a clean image.

from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, Input
import tensorflow as tf

def cnn4dn_mdl(input_shape, layer_width=(8, 16, 8, 4)):
    inputs = Input(shape=input_shape)
    _tmp = inputs
    for _lw in layer_width:
        _tmp = Conv2D(filters=_lw, kernel_size=3, padding='same', activation='relu')(_tmp)
    _out = Conv2D(filters=1, kernel_size=3, padding='same', activation=None)(_tmp)
    return tf.keras.models.Model(inputs, _out)

tf.keras.backend.clear_session()
dn_mdl = cnn4dn_mdl(input_shape=(None, None, 1), layer_width=(8, 16, 8, 4))


Key Parameters:

Kernel size: 3√ó3

Activation: ReLU

Layer widths: (8, 16, 8, 4) filters for successive layers

Padding: Same, to preserve image dimensions


üîπ Step 4: Denoise the Images

The trained CNN model is applied to noisy images to predict clean versions.

denoised_images = [dn_mdl.predict(input_image) for input_image in input_images]


For each input, the model outputs a denoised version highlighting improved clarity and structure.


üîπ Step 5: Visualization

Original, noisy, and denoised images are displayed side by side for comparison.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(15, 20))
for i in range(len(input_images)):
    plt.subplot(3, len(input_images), 3*i + 1)
    plt.imshow(input_images[i].squeeze(), cmap='gray')
    plt.title('Original')
    plt.axis('off')

    plt.subplot(3, len(input_images), 3*i + 2)
    plt.imshow(noisy_images[i].squeeze(), cmap='gray')
    plt.title('Noisy')
    plt.axis('off')

    plt.subplot(3, len(input_images), 3*i + 3)
    plt.imshow(denoised_images[i].squeeze(), cmap='gray')
    plt.title('Denoised')
    plt.axis('off')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

The side-by-side visualization demonstrates the model‚Äôs capability to suppress noise while preserving image structure.
