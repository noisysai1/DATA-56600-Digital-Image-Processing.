Technical Description of Techniques Utilized:

•	Coming to Technical Description, I used Image of Chicago Downtown the skyline which includes a Several Buildings of Downtown.

•	By using CNN, we had initialized the image of Downtown as input and loading the input data Neural networks are digital representations that draw desire for the structure and processes of the human brain.

•	They consist of interconnected layers of nodes or neurons, which process and transmit information. The key components of neural networks are Input, Hidden and Output Layer.
**bold text**
•	Tensor Flow is open-source Machine learning tool provides for building and training various types of neural networks, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image processing.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a type of deep neural network which is frequently used for image processing applications due to their ability to efficiently capture patterns of space in data.

Convolutional Layer: The convolutional layer is the key element of a CNN. It uses a set of adjustable filters (also known as kernels) to extract features from the input image, including edges, textures and forms. Each filter analyzes the input image, performing element-wise multiplication with the local region and summing the results to create a feature map. Multiple filters are often used to capture various features of an input image.

Activation Function Layer: After each convolutional operation, an activation function is performed element by element to bring instability into the network. The ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function is frequently used in CNNs due to its simplicity and efficiency at improving resolution.

Pooling Layer: The pooling layer reduces the feature maps generated by the convolutional layers, lowering their dimension while maintaining critical information. Max pooling and average pooling are the two most used pooling methods. Max pooling takes the highest value from each local zone, whereas average pooling determines the mean value. Pooling reduces computing cost and prevents overfitting by focusing on the most informative attributes.

"""#### Classification Layers and Keras
As you will see, special activation functions are needed for performing classification in Keras.

- `softmax` is a good choice for multi-class (i.e., more than 2 classes) classification problem.
  It takes a vector of real numbers in and returns them in the range [0, 1] with a sum of 1, which looks like a probability distribution.
- `sigmoid` is a good choice for binary classification (only 2 classes) as, like `softmax`, it produces a number on [0, 1]. But, it only takes a single number as input, which makes it simpler than `softmax` to evaluate.
